#SPA-style websites don't fetch all of their pages separately from the server like our sample application does, but instead comprise only one HTML page fetched from the server, the contents of which are manipulated with JavaScript that executes in the browser.

    User->>browser: Uses the botton save

    browser->>server: User input

    Note right of browser:  The event handler immediately calls the method e.preventDefault() to prevent the default handling of form's submit.
#Without this header, the server would not know how to correctly parse the data.

    Note right of browser: The POST request to the address new_note_spa contains the new note as JSON data containing both the content of the note (content) and the timestamp (date)

    Note right of browser: The Content-Type header of the request tells the server that the included data is represented in JSON format.

    Note right of browser: Then the event handler creates a new note, adds it to the notes list with the command notes.push(note), rerenders the note list on the page and sends the new note to the server.

 browser->>server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa

#The SPA version of the app does not traditionally send the form data, but instead uses the JavaScript code it fetched from the server.
